# Plan for Web Page Implementation

## Overview

The web page consists of several distinct sections, each with specific elements and layout requirements. Here's a breakdown of the page:

1. **Header Section**:
   - **Logo**: Positioned at the top center.
   - **Navigation Links**: "Login" and "Sign up" buttons are aligned to the top right.

2. **Main Hero Section**:
   - **Main Heading**: "Don't make connecting awkward" centered on the page.
   - **Subheading**: A brief description centered below the main heading.
   - **Call to Action Button**: "Sign up free" button centered below the subheading.
   - **Background Graphics**: Colorful abstract shapes scattered in the background.
   - **Image of Phones**: Two overlapping phone images centered below the call to action button.

3. **How It Works Section**:
   - **Section Heading**: "Here's how it works" centered.
   - **Subheading**: "More jiving, less shucking." centered below the section heading.
   - **Three Steps**: 
     - **Step 1**: "Scan the QR code" with an icon and description.
     - **Step 2**: "Send a message" with an icon and description.
     - **Step 3**: "Follow-up from your inbox" with an icon and description.
   - **Call to Action Button**: "Start jiving" button centered below the steps.

4. **Footer Section**:
   - **Logo**: Positioned at the bottom center.
   - **Footer Links**: "About", "Privacy", "Terms", and "Contact" links centered below the logo.
   - **Background Graphics**: Additional colorful abstract shapes scattered in the background.

### Layout Considerations

- **Flexbox vs. Grid**: 
  - **Flexbox**: Ideal for the header and footer sections where elements are aligned in a row.
  - **Grid**: Useful for the "How It Works" section to align the three steps in a row.
  - **Recommendation**: Use Flexbox for the header and footer, and CSS Grid for the "How It Works" section.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes, especially for mobile devices.
  - Use media queries to adjust font sizes, button sizes, and image placements.
